"""The pipeline as data: stages, dependencies, resources, hardware gating.

Everything the scheduler needs to know is in `STAGES`, so adding/renaming a stage
is a one-line change and the UI stepper, the API status payload and the run graph
all follow automatically. Two rules are encoded here:

* a stage lists the stages whose **outputs are its inputs** (the directed graph in
  the brief); `video` deliberately does *not* depend on the voice branch — it
  starts from Stage 1's estimate so voice and video run concurrently, and
  `video_fit` (a cheap CPU re-time) reconciles them with Stage 3b's real length;
* `resource` + `requires_gpu` drive the semaphores/VRAM lock that keep an 8GB card
  from ever hosting two models at once.
