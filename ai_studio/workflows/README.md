# ComfyUI workflow templates

The studio never builds a node graph in code — it **injects values into a
ComfyUI API-format workflow** at `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers, then submits it to
`/prompt`. Two consequences:

1. These files are *starting points*. If your ComfyUI / custom-node version names
   things differently, export your own working workflow (ComfyUI → `Save (API Format)`,
   or Dev-mode → *Export (API)*), drop it in this folder
   (`ai_studio/workflows/`) or in `<data_dir>/workflows/`, put the markers where the
   values belong, and pick it in **Settings → Video / SFX**.
2. If a marker is missing, the run says so
   (`unresolved placeholders: …`) rather than quietly rendering the wrong thing.

## Available placeholders

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{{PROMPT}}` | positive visual prompt for the scene (from Stage 1) |
| `{{NEGATIVE}}` | negative prompt (studio default blocks text/watermark/flicker/…) |
| `{{WIDTH}}` `{{HEIGHT}}` | output size, kept ≤ 480×854 by the VRAM guard |
| `{{FRAMES}}` | frame count = clip seconds × `{{FPS}}`, capped by `video.max_frames` |
| `{{FPS}}` | frames per second of the generated clip |
| `{{DURATION}}` | clip length in seconds (float) — MMAudio uses this |
| `{{STEPS}}` `{{CFG}}` `{{SHIFT}}` `{{SEED}}` `{{MOTION}}` | sampler settings |
| `{{TEXT}}` `{{MOOD}}` | the scene's Khmer line and its mood tag |
| `{{SFX_PROMPT}}` | natural-ambience description produced from the mood tag |
| `{{VIDEO_PATH}}` | input video already uploaded into ComfyUI (MMAudio) |
| `{{AUDIO_PATH}}` | input audio inside ComfyUI |
| `{{START_IMAGE}}` | uploaded start frame (Wan2.2 TI2V) |
| `{{OUT_PREFIX}}` | output filename prefix |
| `{{SAMPLE_RATE}}` | audio sample rate |

A placeholder that sits as the *whole* string value is replaced with a typed
value (so `"length": "{{FRAMES}}"` becomes the integer `49`, not `"49"`).

## Wan model files expected by these templates

* `wan2.1_t2v_1.3b_480p.json` — `models/diffusion_models/wan2.1_t2v_1.3B_fp16.safetensors`,
  `models/text_encoders/umt5_xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors`, `models/vae/wan_2.1_vae.safetensors`.
  This is the reliable choice on 8GB VRAM (≈480p, 17–81 frames). Uses the fp8-quantized
  text encoder (6.7GB vs. 11.4GB fp16) — the fp16 encoder alone exceeds the whole 8GB
  budget this profile targets. (Corrected from an earlier version of this file, which
  pointed at the fp16 encoder and had the VAE filename wrong — `wan2.1_vae.safetensors`
  vs. the actually-published `wan_2.1_vae.safetensors`; verified against the live
  Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged file listing.)
* `wan2.2_ti2v_5b_480p.json` — `wan2.2_ti2v_5B_fp16.safetensors` loaded as
  `fp8_e4m3fn_scaled`, `umt5_xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors`, `wan2.2_vae.safetensors`.
  Only switch to this if `Settings → Video` reports enough free VRAM; start ComfyUI with
  `--lowvram` (or `--cache-none`) so its native offloading keeps you under 8GB.
* `mmaudio_small_480p.json` — needs the [`kijai/ComfyUI-MMAudio`](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-MMAudio)
  node pack and the **small** model set in `ComfyUI/models/mmaudio/` (the small
  checkpoint is the "below 8GB VRAM" flavour; `mmaudio_large_44k_v2` is not).
